## mpCLOUD
An in-browser music production and performance application that allows users to upload and edit their own sound-sets.

## Motivation
For songwriters, producers and beat-makers, there are thousands of tools (both hardware and software) we use to create, perform and edit music with. My favorites are mostly in the the sample-based drum machine category. Within this category, a few pieces stand out - Akai's MPC, Ableton's Push and Native Instruments’ Maschine. Some work in tandem with software run on a computer, and others are standalone music production centers.

Unfortunately these are expensive pieces of equipment, making them out of reach for many potential users. They can also be heavy and cumbersome to cart around and set up. Also, despite the fact we live in the era of the Internet of Things, these devices are also largely isolated from the web and therefore loading sounds into these devices is slow, and collaboration can be difficult.

I wanted to build a cloud-based drum machine to allow people to create and collaborate on music with everyday computers, smartphones and tablets - hence the name MPCloud (Music Production Cloud).
